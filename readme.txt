A plugin to strip out lines of HTML generated by Wordpress and other plugins based on predefined regular expressions.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to specify patterns of HTML that will be removed from the final output. You can define such patterns as normal text (e.g. "penguin" will remove all lines in the output HTML containing "penguin") or as a regular expression (e.g. "WinterIs(Coming|Here)" will remove all lines of text containing either "WinterIsComing" or "WinterIsHere").

For more information on regular expressions, see [regular-expressions.info](http://www.regular-expressions.info).

If you come across any bugs in the plugin, or if you have any suggestions on how to make it better, [contact me directly](https://davidlyness.com/contact) or use the Wordpress plugin support forums.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
